        <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
        <h4>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost" target="_blank">Robert Frost</a></h4>
        <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
            And sorry I could not travel both <br>
            And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
            And looked down one as far as I could <br>
            To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
            <br>
            Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
            And having perha ps the better claim,<br>
            Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
            Though as for that the passing there<br>
            Had worn them really about the same,<br>
            <br>
            And both that morning equally lay<br>
            In leaves, no step had trodden black.<br>
            Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
            Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
            I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
            <br>
            I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
            Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
            I took the one less traveled by,<br>
            And that has made all the difference<br>
        </p>
